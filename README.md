This branch have some troubles, mainly some data are lost at brieft time intervals, also It's not possible to use the maximum power of the radio. The structure of the loop is not the best since the operations to send and recieve are not confined in a specific time interval and the program can stop to work when other functionalities will be added. Corrections will be performed in other branches.

The code for joystick is in https://github.com/carlosgellida/RF24_joystick.git.
